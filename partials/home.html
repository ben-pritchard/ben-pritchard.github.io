    <h1>What's this?</h1>
    <p>My name is Ben Pritchard and for the past couple of years I've been developing my web development skills through classes at Portland Community College as well as through a web development bootcamp called Epicodus.</p>

    <h1>A little background:</h1>
    <p>I started life after college as a corporate tax accountant. While I didn't hate it, I wanted to do some more exploring of the world and of myself, as well as work somewhere I could get my heart into my work. So I did a year of AmeriCorps along the East Coast doing service projects and then traveled around in South America teaching English among other things for a year. All this exploration has led me to where I am today, pursuing a life where I can engage the technical side of my mind while working for causes that my heart feels good about.</p>
