    <h1>What's this?</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage! I'm experimenting a bit but mainly have this up because I'm a web developer and you kind of have to have one :)</p>
    <p>
      My mission in this web development venture is to learn as much as I can and then give back by working for a cause I believe in.

    <h1>A little background:</h1>
    <p>I started life after college as a corporate tax accountant. While I didn't hate it, I wanted to do some more exploring of the world and of myself, as well as work somewhere I could get my heart into my work. So I did a year of AmeriCorps along the East Coast doing service projects and then traveled around in South America teaching English among other things for a year. All this exploration has led me to where I am today, pursuing a life where I can engage the technical side of my mind while working for causes that my heart feels good about.</p>
